                        I am a responsible, goal-oriented and proactive person.
                        I have been learning frontend in depth for last six month.
                        Before that I was studying computer science at School 21,
                        back there I had been using C as main language, and I created
                        few projects using C. Also I created my own server on linux.
                        Right now I am using ReactJS as main library I spend my time in
                        codewars and leetcode and I get a lot of fun solving programming problems
                    </p>

            </div>
        </div>
